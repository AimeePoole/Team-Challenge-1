# Team-Challenge-1
Navigation and User Experience

In teams, you must create your new BSU website (or at least, some of it!) Your site must contain:
- At least 1 HTML file per team member. (including a home page)
- Exactly one CSS stylesheet.
- Links connecting your pages together.
- Images and/or file downloads.
- You may use text, images, and files from the real BSU website. You may use your sitemaps as a starting point.
